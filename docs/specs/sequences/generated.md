# Generated sequences

These are the exact sequences being checked by the sequence tool. They are programaticaly generated
so maybe a bit cryptic, but they accurately represent the specific steps required for each test.

<!--

To regenerate the contents of this file below, first generate a message trace sequence and then run bin/gencode_seq

* Running "bin/test_sequencer target-gcp-project" will run through the complete battery of test sequences
  against the AHU-1 device to create the requisite trace files. This takes about 4 min for a complete test run.

* Then run "bin/gencode_seq" which consumes the generated trace files and creates "generated.md" (this file)
  with the output. The diff (using git, usually) should then reflect the changes against the committed version.

Some caveats:

* Flaky tests are annoying. Sometimes something goes wrong and one entire test will be borked. Easist thing
  is to just re-run the sequence tests until it's clean, but that's not always the fastest.

* The gencode part requires a complete test run to work properly, but you can run individual test runs
  as needed, e.g. "bin/sequencer sites/udmi_site/model target-gcp-project AHU-1 21632 system_last_update"
  (you will need to run an instance of pubber separately).

## endpoint_redirect_and_restart

Reconnect the device to a new endpoint, restart, make sure it returns

1. Wait for initial last_config matches config timestamp
1. Update config before blobset phase is apply and stateStatus is null:
    * Add `blobset` = { "blobs": { "_iot_endpoint_config": { "phase": `final`, "generation": `blob generation`, "sha256": `blob data hash`, "url": `endpoint url` } } }
1. Wait for blobset phase is apply and stateStatus is null
1. Check that no interesting system status
1. Wait for blobset phase is final and stateStatus is null
1. Check that no interesting system status
1. Wait for alternate last_config matches config timestamp
1. Update config before endpoint config blobset state not defined:
    * Remove `blobset.blobs._iot_endpoint_config`
1. Wait for endpoint config blobset state not defined
1. Wait for last_start is not zero
1. Check that initial count is greater than 0
1. Update config before system mode is ACTIVE:
    * Add `system.operation.mode` = `active`
1. Wait for system mode is ACTIVE
1. Update config:
    * Set `system.operation.mode` = `restart`
1. Wait for system mode is INITIAL
1. Check that restart count increased by one
1. Update config:
    * Set `system.operation.mode` = `active`
1. Wait for system mode is ACTIVE
1. Wait for last_config is newer than previous last_config before abort
1. Wait for last_config is newer than previous last_config after abort
1. Wait for last_start is same as previous last_start
1. Update config before blobset phase is apply and stateStatus is null:
    * Add `blobset.blobs._iot_endpoint_config` = { "phase": `final`, "generation": `blob generation`, "sha256": `blob data hash`, "url": `endpoint url` }
1. Wait for blobset phase is apply and stateStatus is null
1. Check that no interesting system status
1. Wait for blobset phase is final and stateStatus is null
1. Check that no interesting system status
1. Wait for restored last_config matches config timestamp
1. Update config before endpoint config blobset state not defined:
    * Remove `blobset.blobs._iot_endpoint_config`
1. Wait for endpoint config blobset state not defined
